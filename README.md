1. Balanced Brackets Write a function that takes a string of brackets as the input, and determines if the order of the brackets is valid. A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ]. We say a sequence of brackets is valid if the following conditions are met: ● It contains no unmatched brackets. ● The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets. Examples: ● (){}[] is valid ● [{()}](){} is valid ● []{() is not valid ● [{)] is not valid 2. Contact List Create a REST API which will store people and their contacts.
